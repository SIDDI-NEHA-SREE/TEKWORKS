🟣 “News Topic Discovery Dashboard” Using Hierarchical Clustering
1️⃣ App Title & Description
Title:
🟣 “News Topic Discovery Dashboard”
Short Description:
“This system uses Hierarchical Clustering to automatically group similar news articles based on textual similarity.”
Purpose (implicit for students):
👉 Discover hidden themes without defining categories upfront.
2️⃣ Input Section (Sidebar – Mandatory)
The sidebar should allow users to control how hierarchical clustering is performed.
📂 Dataset Handling
Upload CSV file (or pre-load Kaggle dataset)
Automatically detect:
Text column (e.g., news, text, headline)
📝 Text Vectorization Controls
User should select:
• Maximum TF-IDF Features
Slider (100 to 2000)
Default: 1000
• Stop Words Removal
Checkbox (Use English stopwords)
• N-gram Range (Optional Bonus)
Dropdown:
Unigrams
Bigrams
Unigrams + Bigrams
🌳 Hierarchical Clustering Controls
• Linkage Method
Dropdown:
Ward
Complete
Average
Single
• Distance Metric
Dropdown:
Euclidean
• Number of Articles for Dendrogram
Slider (20 – 200)

(Important: Dendrogram for subset only)
3️⃣ Clustering Control (Important)
Add a button:
🟦 “Generate Dendrogram”
This ensures students understand:
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree first
We decide cluster count after inspecting tree
After dendrogram inspection:
🟩 “Apply Clustering”
User selects:

• Number of Clusters (based on dendrogram)
4️⃣ Dendrogram Section (Main Panel – Core Part)
Display:
Dendrogram visualization
Y-axis: Distance
X-axis: Article index
Students must visually inspect:
Large vertical gaps
Natural separation levels
Optional:
Allow drawing horizontal cut line (slider for height)
5️⃣ Clustering Visualization Section
Since text is high dimensional:
Project clusters using:
• PCA (2D reduction)
Display:
2D scatter plot
Points colored by cluster
Hover shows sample article snippet
This updates dynamically when:
Linkage changes
Number of clusters changes
6️⃣ Cluster Summary Section (Business View)
Display a table:
Cluster ID	Number of Articles	Top Keywords
For each cluster:
Extract top 10 TF-IDF terms
Show most representative article snippet
This helps editors understand:
What topic each cluster represents
7️⃣ Validation Section 
Since no labels exist, display:
📊 Silhouette Score
Show:
Numeric value
Short explanation:
Close to 1 → well-separated clusters
Close to 0 → overlapping clusters
Negative → poor clustering
Add optional:
Silhouette score comparison for different linkage methods
8️⃣ Business Interpretation Section (Human Language Only)
Below results, display insights like:
🟣 Cluster 0: Articles related to financial markets and stock performance

🟡 Cluster 1: Corporate earnings and quarterly results

🔵 Cluster 2: Economic policy and government announcements
Language must:
Avoid ML terminology
Focus on editorial usefulness
9️⃣ User Guidance / Insight Box
Display:
“Articles grouped in the same cluster share similar vocabulary and themes. These clusters can be used for automatic tagging, recommendations, and content organization.”
